Setups

An evaluation of the set up, effort wise, and documenation.

## Elixir

I used Phoenix. Dead simple to get the server up with JSON output as well as content type.

Was a little more work to find out how to do the date, then apply pattern matching for the output.

## Go

I just used basic Go http libraries. A little more challenging.

Getting the date out to a string was 'interesting', but it came out once I found some Gorilla examples, easily googled.

## Node.js

Dead simple. Used Node.js http server.

Just follow a simple google guide, and you've got the date as JSON.

## Ruby

I used sinatra, and as expected was super easy like the sinatra website shows.

## Scala

Well well, where to start. Took a lot more effort and things downloading to get it going. Then I got the server going and i had to download more. Wasn't a pleasant experience.

Ended up going with Scalatra - http://www.scalatra.org/getting-started/first-project.html
